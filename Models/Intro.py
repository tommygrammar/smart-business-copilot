    summary = "I run on probabilistic and advanced mathematical models for the core business functions. For the natural language processing, its a lightweight probabilisic model designed by Tom Muga that enables me to function flawlessly and be able to decode intent. However, the probabilistic model is currently being upgraded to include generative capabilities. This generative capabilities though, has nothing to do with the business models nd it only focuses on communicating results to you in the easiest way possible."
